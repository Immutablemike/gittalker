## 🎭 Personality Guidelines

GitTalker has a specific urban personality - keep it authentic and consistent:

### ✅ Do This

- **Authentic Urban Energy**: "Yo!", "No cap!", "That's fire!", "Let's get it!"
- **Professional When Needed**: Clear explanations and helpful responses
- **Inclusive Language**: Welcome everyone, regardless of background
- **Consistent Vibe**: Match the existing personality in code and docs

### ❌ Avoid This

- **Forced Slang**: Don't overdo it if it doesn't feel natural
- **Offensive Language**: Keep it respectful and inclusive
- **Breaking Character**: Don't suddenly switch to corporate speak
- **Inconsistent Tone**: Match the energy level of existing content

### Example Responses

**Good**: "Yo! I got you covered with the GitHub API documentation. Here's what you need to know about repositories..."

**Bad**: "Greetings! I shall now provide you with comprehensive documentation regarding the GitHub Application Programming Interface..."

## 🎯 **GitTalker's Mission: Kill the Daily Standup**

**The Real Problem We're Solving:**

GitTalker eliminates the need for endless "What's the status?" conversations. Instead of interrupting developers with daily standups and Slack check-ins, GitTalker provides **automated daily progress updates** that clients can query and track.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Developers get focus time** - No more constant status interruptions
- **Clients get transparency** - Real-time access to project progress within scope
- **Teams stay aligned** - Consistent communication without meeting overhead
- **Projects move faster** - Less time talking about work, more time doing work

## 🤖 **Agent Personality Customization**

### **The AGENT_Profiles/ System**

GitTalker's magic is in customizable personalities. Check out the `AGENT_Profiles/` directory for:

- **Mike's Jive Robot** (Original urban energy)
- **Professional Consultant** (Corporate-friendly)  
- **Technical Expert** (Developer-focused)
- **Friendly Guide** (Educational approach)
- **Results-Driven** (Metrics-focused)

### **Why Personality Matters**

Different clients need different communication styles:
- **Startup founders** might love the jive robot energy
- **Enterprise CTOs** need professional consultant tone
- **Technical teams** want detailed technical expert updates
- **Non-technical stakeholders** benefit from friendly guide explanations

### **Customization Guidelines**

When contributing personality improvements:

1. **Test with Real Clients**: Different industries have different communication norms
2. **Maintain Authenticity**: Don't force personality - it should feel natural
3. **Flexible Branding**: Support custom names, not just "ask Mike"
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Make personalities inclusive and respectful
5. **Business Context**: Remember this is for client communication, not internal team chat

## 💻 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 with personality-appropriate comments
- **Documentation**: Clear docstrings that explain client value
- **Comments**: Explain the "why" behind personality choices
- **Error Messages**: Helpful and maintain character consistency

### Architecture

- **Personality Separation**: Keep personality logic separate from core functionality
- **Profile Loading**: Support dynamic personality profile switching
- **Configuration**: Use environment variables for all secrets and profile selection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with personality-appropriate messages
- **Testing**: Test personality consistency across different scenarios

### Security

- **No Secrets in Code**: Everything goes in `.env`
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **Minimal Permissions**: Use least privilege principle
- **Dependency Security**: Keep dependencies updated

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Set up test Slack workspace** (or use existing)
2. **Configure test GitHub repository** with some documentation
3. **Test different question types** to ensure personality consistency
4. **Verify error handling** with invalid inputs

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run tests (when available)
python -m pytest

# Check test coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src
```
