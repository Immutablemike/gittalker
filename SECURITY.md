## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**🚨 Don't create public issues for security vulnerabilities!**

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in GitTalker, please report it responsibly.

### 🔒 Private Reporting (Recommended)

**For sensitive security issues:**

- **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**: Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Immutablemike/gittalker/security/advisories/new) feature
- **Direct Contact**: Send a private message to [@Immutablemike](https://github.com/Immutablemike) on GitHub
- **Profile Contact**: Visit [https://github.com/Immutablemike](https://github.com/Immutablemike) for additional contact methods

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to demonstrate the issue
- **Impact Assessment**: What data/systems could be affected
- **Environment Details**: Python version, dependencies, deployment context
- **Potential Fix**: If you have suggestions for remediation
- **Your Contact Info**: How we can reach you for follow-up questions

### ⚡ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of your report
- **Assessment**: We'll validate and assess the issue within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Timeline depends on severity, but we prioritize security fixes
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate with you on public disclosure timing

### 🎯 Scope

**Security issues we're interested in:**

- Authentication bypasses in Slack integration
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, etc.)
- Unauthorized access to GitHub repositories
- Information disclosure through logs or error messages
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerabilities with actual exploit paths

**Out of scope:**

- Theoretical attacks without proof of concept
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Issues in third-party dependencies without GitTalker-specific impact

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

| Version | Supported | Notes |

| 1.x.x   | ✅ | Current stable release |
| 0.x.x   | ❌ | Pre-release versions |

## 🔐 Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Token Scoping**: GitHub tokens use minimal required permissions
- **Input Validation**: User inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability checks
- **Code Review**: All changes require review before merging

### Planned Security Enhancements

- **Automated Security Scanning**: GitHub CodeQL and Dependabot
- **Security Headers**: Implement security headers for web endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced logging for security-relevant events

## 🤝 Security Community

### Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

- **Credit researchers** who report valid security issues (with permission)
- **Coordinate disclosure timing** to protect users
- **Provide updates** on fix progress and timeline
- **Maintain confidentiality** throughout the process

### Bug Bounty
