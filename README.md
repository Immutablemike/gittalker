# GitTalker - AI-Powered Project Communication

**Embed an AI agent in your repository that provides real-time project updates and Q&A management to stakeholders in Slack - eliminate daily standups with automated, timestamped progress communication**

## üéØ The Problem

**Modern development teams waste countless hours on status updates:**
- Daily standups that interrupt deep work
- "What's the status?" Slack messages every few hours  
- Non-technical stakeholders needing constant project visibility
- Founders and senior devs requiring progress transparency
- Repetitive explanations of the same project details

**The cost:** Broken focus, context-switching, and projects that take 2x longer due to communication overhead.

## ‚ö° The Solution

GitTalker embeds an AI agent in your repository that becomes your **automated project communication system**. Stakeholders get instant, accurate project updates without interrupting your development flow.

**Replace daily standups with real-time project intelligence:**
- **Automated progress updates** triggered by commits and milestones
- **Timestamped project status** available 24/7 in Slack
- **Stakeholder self-service** for project questions and timeline queries
- **Professional communication** even when you're heads-down coding

**One-line installation:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Immutablemike/gittalker/main/INSTALL/install.sh | bash
```

## ÔøΩ How It Works

**Automated Stakeholder Communication:**

### Professional Project Updates
- **Mirror key documentation** ‚Üí Copy README, roadmap, or changelog to your knowledge base
- **Automated progress tracking** ‚Üí Timestamp updates triggered by commits and milestones  
- **Self-service project information** ‚Üí Stakeholders get instant answers without interrupting dev work
- **Customizable communication style** ‚Üí Choose from professional, technical, or friendly AI personalities

### Intelligent Scope Management
Stakeholders can ask project questions and get informed responses:

```text
Stakeholder: "What's included in this project?"
GitTalker: Based on the project scope, we're building:
‚Ä¢ User authentication system
‚Ä¢ Dashboard with analytics 
‚Ä¢ Mobile-responsive design
‚Ä¢ Basic reporting features

NOT included: Advanced reporting, third-party integrations, mobile app.

Stakeholder: "Can we add real-time notifications?"
GitTalker: That's outside my current knowledge scope - ask Mike directly for scope changes and timeline impact.
```

### Developer-Focused Benefits
For developers who need to maintain focus while keeping stakeholders informed:

- **Controlled information sharing** ‚Üí You decide what goes in the knowledge base
- **Professional communication** ‚Üí Consistent, polished responses even when you're busy
- **Scope boundary enforcement** ‚Üí Clear "in scope" vs "ask developer directly" responses
- **Context preservation** ‚Üí No more explaining the same project details repeatedly

```

### Custom Configuration

Edit `.gittalker/config.json` to customize file scanning:

```json
{
    "scan_patterns": {
        "python": ["**/*.py", "**/requirements.txt", "**/docs/**"]
    },
    "ai_focus_areas": ["code_quality", "performance", "testing"]
}
```

### Command Options

```bash
./gittalker chat    # Interactive chat mode
./gittalker scan    # Rescan project files  
./gittalker docs    # Generate documentation

# Shorthand versions
./gittalker c       # Chat

```

### Python API

Use GitTalker programmatically:

## üîß Customizing Your Knowledge Base

**Mirror important project docs:**
```bash
# Copy key project information
cp README.md .gittalker/gittalker/project-overview.md
cp CHANGELOG.md .gittalker/gittalker/progress-log.md

# Create controlled updates
echo "$(date): Authentication module completed" >> .gittalker/gittalker/daily-updates.md
```

**Scope boundary examples:**
```markdown
# What's NOT included in this project:
- Real-time chat features
- Third-party payment processing  
- Mobile app (web-responsive only)
- Advanced analytics dashboard

# Questions outside scope:
Ask Mike directly for timeline changes, budget discussions, or scope modifications.
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Matters

**For Solo Developers:**
- Clients get instant answers without interrupting your flow
- Professional communication even when you're heads-down coding
- Clear project boundaries prevent scope creep conversations

**For Development Teams:**  
- Consistent project communication across all team members
- Junior devs protected from client pressure and scope discussions
- Senior devs freed from constant status update requests

**For Agencies:**
- Scale client communication without hiring more account managers
- Maintain professional client relationships with less overhead
- Protect billable development time from communication tasks

## ÔøΩÔ∏è For Developers: Focus Protection

**The developer-focused benefits** that protect your deep work:

**Controlled Information Sharing:**
- **You curate the knowledge base** - Only information you put in `gittalker/` gets shared
- **Scope boundary enforcement** - Requests outside your documentation get redirected to you
- **Professional communication** - Consistent, polished responses even when you're heads-down
- **Context preservation** - No more explaining the same project details repeatedly

**Automated Deflection:**
```text
Stakeholder: "Can we add real-time notifications?"
GitTalker: "That's outside my current knowledge scope - ask Mike directly for scope changes and timeline impact."

Stakeholder: "Why is this taking longer than expected?"
GitTalker: "Based on current timeline documentation, we're tracking to original estimates. For timeline concerns, please discuss directly with Mike."
```

**Developer Workflow Integration:**
```bash
# Mirror key docs to knowledge base
cp README.md .gittalker/gittalker/project-overview.md
cp CHANGELOG.md .gittalker/gittalker/progress-log.md

# Add daily controlled updates
echo "$(date): Authentication module completed" >> .gittalker/gittalker/daily-updates.md

# Stakeholders get updates, you stay focused
```

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Sandboxed operation** - AI only accesses the `gittalker/` directory
- **No code exposure** - Your source code never leaves your repository  
- **Controlled information sharing** - You decide exactly what gets communicated
- **Audit trail** - All AI responses logged for review
