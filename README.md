# GitTalker - Universal AI Project Companion

**Drop-in AI assistant for any software project**

## üéØ What It's About

**The Problem:** Every developer wastes hours context-switching between documentation, Stack Overflow, and their actual code. You know your project intimately, but getting AI help means explaining your entire codebase every single time.

**The Solution:** GitTalker becomes your project's permanent AI companion. One install command gives you an AI that already understands your codebase, architecture, and patterns. No more explaining context - just get instant, project-specific help.

## ‚ö° TLDR

```bash
# One command in any project directory
curl -fsSL https://install.gittalker.io | bash

# Your AI companion is ready
cd .gittalker && ./gittalker chat
```

**Result:** AI that knows your code, answers your questions, and helps you ship faster.

## üöÄ One-Line Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.gittalker.io | bash
```

Works with **any LLM** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, vLLM - both local and corporate models.

## What GitTalker Does

üß† **Understands Your Codebase** - Automatically scans and indexes your project files  
üí¨ **Provides Instant Help** - Chat interface for code questions, debugging, and suggestions  
üìö **Generates Documentation** - Creates comprehensive docs from your code  
üîç **Code Analysis** - Reviews code quality, suggests improvements  
üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Insights** - Understands your project structure and patterns  

## Supported Projects

‚úÖ **Python** - Django, Flask, FastAPI, pip, poetry  
‚úÖ **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Node.js, React, Vue, Angular, npm, yarn  
‚úÖ **Go** - Standard Go projects with go.mod  
‚úÖ **Rust** - Cargo-based projects  
‚úÖ **Java** - Maven, Gradle projects  
‚úÖ **PHP** - Composer projects  
‚úÖ **Any Project** - Generic documentation and analysis  

## Quick Start

After running the installer in your project:

```bash
# Enter GitTalker companion
cd .gittalker

# Scan and index your project  
./gittalker scan

# Start AI chat session
./gittalker chat

# Generate documentation
./gittalker docs
```

### Example Chat Session

```
You: How can I improve the performance of my API?
GitTalker: I've analyzed your FastAPI project. Here are specific optimizations:

1. Add async/await to your database queries in src/models.py
2. Implement response caching for your /api/users endpoint  
3. Consider connection pooling for your PostgreSQL database

Would you like me to show you the specific code changes?

You: Yes, show me the async database changes
GitTalker: Here's how to update your User model in src/models.py:
[Shows specific code examples based on your actual files]
```

## How It Works

### Smart Detection
Automatically detects your project type by analyzing package files, project structure, and build configurations.

### Lightweight Installation  
Creates a single `.gittalker/` directory with:

- Companion client for AI interaction
- Project-specific configuration  
- Local knowledge base of your code
- Interactive chat interface

### Zero Interference

- Adds only one directory to your project
- Automatically updates `.gitignore`
- No modifications to existing code
- Works alongside any existing tools

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration

Edit `.gittalker/config.json` to customize file scanning:

```json
{
    "scan_patterns": {
        "python": ["**/*.py", "**/requirements.txt", "**/docs/**"]
    },
    "ai_focus_areas": ["code_quality", "performance", "testing"]
}
```

### Command Options

```bash
./gittalker chat    # Interactive chat mode
./gittalker scan    # Rescan project files  
./gittalker docs    # Generate documentation

# Shorthand versions
./gittalker c       # Chat
./gittalker s       # Scan
./gittalker d       # Docs
```

### Python API

Use GitTalker programmatically:

```python
from gittalker.client import GitTalkerClient

client = GitTalkerClient()
client.scan_project()
# Project is now indexed and ready for AI queries
```

## System Requirements

- **Git repository** - Must be run from within a git project
- **Python 3.7+** - For the companion client interface
- **Internet connection** - To communicate with GitTalker AI service (unless using local models)

## Privacy & Security

- **Local processing** - Project files analyzed locally
- **Secure communication** - Encrypted connection to AI service
- **No code storage** - Your code is not stored on external servers
- **Opt-in sharing** - You control what information is sent

## Architecture

GitTalker uses a hybrid architecture combining:

- **Agent Services** - Context-aware AI decision making (<50ms)
- **Direct Services** - High-performance computational tasks (<10ms)  
- **Hybrid Applications** - Intelligent coordination with automatic routing

This enables optimal performance across different use cases while maintaining intelligent behavior.
